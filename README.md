# PyBlockCode
PyBlockCode is a graphical code editor for python that allows new coders to learn basics of python easier.
It's quite simple to add your own blocks. Just look at Blocks.py and add your own block. Sadly not all python files are compatible, but you should have no problem with loading files made in PyBlockCode.
